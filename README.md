# Telecom-Data-Analysis (Python)
In this project, I performed a comprehensive analysis of data from a telecommunications company to gain insights into customer churn behavior. The project follows a structured approach involving various phases including data collection, preparation, processing, analysis, and visualization. The aim is to extract meaningful insights that can aid in making data-driven decisions to reduce churn and improve customer retention.
# Ask
Some of the questions we aim to answer in this project include:

- What factors contribute to customer churn in the telecom industry?

- Can we identify patterns or trends in customer behavior that precede churn events?

- Which customer segments are most prone to churning?

- Are there specific services or contract types that correlate with higher churn rates?

- How can the company leverage this analysis to reduce churn and improve customer satisfaction?

 # Key Findings
- Customers with month-to-month contracts exhibit higher churn rates.
- Lack of online security and technical support services are associated with higher churn.
- Customers in their first year of subscription are more likely to churn.
- Fiber optics internet service subscribers have higher churn rates.
- Non-senior citizens tend to have higher churn rates compared to senior citizens.
- Customers using electronic check as a payment method have the highest churn rates.
- Churn tends to be higher when monthly charges are high, particularly when combined with lower tenure and total charges.
